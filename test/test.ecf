	Pyxis is data format inspired by the Python programming language and designed to be a more
	readable supplement/substitute for XML configuration files.
	Pyxis as an acronym stands for: Pythonic XML ideal source.
	It is also a Latin transliteration of a Greek word for a type of pottery used by women to hold
	cosmetics, trinkets or jewellery.
	The following is project configuration data for an Eiffel programming language project
	compiled with the EiffelStudio IDE
	This project contains a parser for the Pyxis format and a Pyxis to XML convertion utility
