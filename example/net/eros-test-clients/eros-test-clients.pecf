# Pyxis is data format inspired by the Python programming language and designed to be a more
# readable supplement/substitute for XML configuration files.

# Pyxis as an acronym stands for: Pythonic XML ideal source.
# It is also a Latin transliteration of a Greek word for a type of pottery used by women to hold 
# cosmetics, trinkets or jewellery. 

# The following is project configuration data for an Eiffel programming language project
# compiled with the EiffelStudio IDE

# This project contains a parser for the Pyxis format and a Pyxis to XML convertion utility
